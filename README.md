Welcome to my GitHub profile! üòÅ  My name is Jonas and I am a software engineering student in my second year. 
I am passionate about learning object-oriented programming and front-end development.

On my profile, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my skills and interests in these areas.
From small applications built using OOP principles to front-end development projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
I am constantly learning and expanding my skillset.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions or collaborations in mind.
