Welcome to my GitHub profile! 😁  I am a software engineering student in my fourth year. 
I am passionate about learning cloud, embedded, and systems engineering, and exploring new languages for development.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions or collaborations in mind. 

Currently working on Senior Engineering Capstone - Sortify!
